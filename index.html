                <p id="tribute-intro">Momofuku Ando was the inventor of the ultimate food staple of young adults everywhere, instant ramen.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>1910</b> - Born in Gô Peh-hok, Japanese Taiwan, Empire of Japan <em>(now Puzi, Chiayi County, Taiwan)</em></li>
                    <li><b>1932</b> - Started his own textiles company</li>
                    <li><b>1948</b> - Jailed and went bankrupt</li>
                    <li><b>1958</b> - Marketed the first package of precooked instant noodles</li>
                    <li><b>1971</b> - Invented Cup Noodles, complete with Styrofoam cup</li>
                    <li><b>1982</b> - Received the Order of the Sacred Treasure honor</li>
                    <li><b>2002</b> - Received the Order of the Rising Sun honor</li>

                <p>Ando was a great example of how to bounce back from a devastating failure to achieve world-renowned success that continued after his death. Ando also was proof that people can live a long life while eating ramen almost every day.</p>
